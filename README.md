# Kali-Update-Script

# Created by Nathan Clifford for Fleming College CSI Students

# Usage Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/gnarlyhaze/Kali-Update-Script.git 

cd Kali-Update-Script

chmod u+x Update.sh

sudo ./Update.sh

# Description:
This script is for updating, and performing basic configuration on Linux distros that use apt as the package manager (ie. Kali, Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu).

This means that if you're using a different package manager such as yum (ie. RedHat, Fedora, OpenSuse) then this script will probably not work on your OS.

There are some other miscellaneous scripts contained in the download that you may find helpful.
